This repo consists of three files:

1. Index.html - A basic HTML document used to call the JavaScript script.

2. Client.js - The JavaScript code that runs the conditionals test.

3. README.md - This README file.

The script is a function that takes in two values and compares them.  It will report back which value is bigger.
